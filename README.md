# DTE‑I -- Digital Trust Ethics, Islamic‑Inspired

Practical framework for ethical cybersecurity and AI, interoperable with ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27701, ISO/IEC 42001, NIST CSF 2.0, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, and GDPR.

## Overview

DTE‑I is a value‑aligned, auditable framework that bridges technical controls and ethical governance. It translates universal principles--privacy, dignity, fairness, accountability--through Maqasid lenses (life, wealth, dignity, intellect, justice) into operational “shall” requirements, checklists, and templates.

## Key contents

- `standards/`
  - DTE‑I Standard v0.9 (public review draft)
  - Alignment crosswalk: ISO 27001, NIST CSF 2.0, ISO 27701, ISO 42001, EU AI Act, GDPR
- `templates/`
  - Ethical Assurance Statement
  - Privacy by Design Policy
  - AI Transparency Note
  - Bias Risk Register
  - Dignity‑aware Incident Communications
- `checklists/`
  - Governance Self‑Assessment (v1.0)
  - 40‑Item Organizational Self‑Assessment
- `posts/`
  - LinkedIn posts (Arabic/English) 1--4; drafts 5--15 for rollout
- `roadmap/`
  - Two‑Week Sprint plan and v1.0 release plan

## Why DTE‑I?

- **From compliance to conviction:** value‑driven tie‑breakers when controls conflict.
- **Cultural legitimacy:** inclusive, globally relevant, with added resonance in Muslim‑majority markets.
- **Measurable trust:** fairness KPIs, oversight efficacy, dignity‑centered incident comms.

## Standards and regulations alignment

- ISO/IEC 27001: ISMS controls (access, crypto, ops, continuity)
- ISO/IEC 27701: PIMS (privacy by design/default, DPIA, rights)
- ISO/IEC 42001: AIMS (AI governance: context, leadership, risk, operation)
- NIST CSF 2.0; NIST AI RMF
- EU AI Act (risk, transparency, oversight, logging) and GDPR

## Project status

- v0.9 Draft published for public review
- v1.0 Target after comment resolution
- See `roadmap/` for timeline

## Quick start

1) Use the Governance Self‑Assessment to baseline maturity
2) Adopt the Privacy by Design Policy and apply DPIA triggers
3) Document your AI systems with the AI Transparency Note
4) Stand up a Bias Risk Register and define fairness KPIs
5) Publish an Ethical Assurance Statement (external trust signal)
