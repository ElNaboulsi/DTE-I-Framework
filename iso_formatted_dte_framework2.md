## Foreword

This International Standard was prepared by the DTE-I International Standards Consortium in collaboration with cybersecurity professionals, Islamic scholars, privacy engineers, and artificial intelligence researchers worldwide.

This document follows the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (2018) and is structured according to the requirements for International Standards. It is intended for integration into the ISO/IEC 27000 series of information security management standards.

Users of this International Standard should be aware that all International Standards undergo revision from time to time and that any reference made herein to any other International Standard implies its latest edition, unless otherwise stated.

## Introduction

### General

The digital transformation of society has created unprecedented opportunities for human advancement while simultaneously introducing complex ethical challenges that traditional cybersecurity and privacy frameworks struggle to address comprehensively. This International Standard addresses this gap by providing a systematic approach to ethical technology governance based on universal moral principles derived from Islamic jurisprudence (Maqasid al-Shariah) while remaining applicable across all cultural and religious contexts.

### Process approach

This International Standard promotes the adoption of a process approach when developing, implementing and improving the effectiveness of a Digital Trust Ethics Management System (DTE-MS) to enhance stakeholder trust and organizational ethical performance.

Understanding and managing interrelated processes as a system contributes to the organization's effectiveness and efficiency in achieving its intended outcomes. This approach enables the organization to control the interrelationships and interdependencies among the processes of the system, so that the overall performance can be enhanced.

### Relationship with other management systems

This International Standard is designed to be compatible with ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management), ISO/IEC 42001 (Artificial Intelligence Management), and ISO/IEC 27701 (Privacy Information Management). Organizations can integrate the DTE-MS with existing management systems to create a unified approach to digital trust.

## Scope

### General

This International Standard specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving a Digital Trust Ethics Management System (DTE-MS).

This International Standard is applicable to organizations of all sizes, types and nature. The organization can choose to apply this International Standard to the entire organization or to specific parts of it.

### Application

This International Standard enables organizations to:

a) demonstrate their commitment to ethical technology practices based on universal moral principles;

b) address stakeholder requirements related to digital trust and ethical technology use;

c) achieve and maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations across multiple jurisdictions;

d) continually improve their digital trust performance through systematic management processes;
