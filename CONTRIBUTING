# How to Contribute to DTE-I

We welcome contributions to the DTE-I framework, especially regarding ethical cybersecurity and AI governance documentation and templates.

## Scope of Contributions

Contributions should focus on enhancing, clarifying, or expanding the DTE-I framework, its standards, templates, and checklists. This includes:
- Proposing improvements to existing documents.
- Suggesting new templates or checklists.
- Identifying errors or inconsistencies.
- Enhancing alignment with relevant standards and regulations.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy of the `DTE-I` repository on GitHub.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Download your copy to your local machine.
3.  **Create a New Branch:** For each set of changes, create a new branch (e.g., `feature/add-new-template`, `fix/typo-in-checklist`).
4.  **Make Your Changes:** Edit files or add new ones.
5.  **Commit Your Changes:** Use clear and concise [conventional commit messages](#commit-messages).
6.  **Push to Your Fork:** Upload your changes to your GitHub fork.
7.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):** Go to the original `DTE-I` repository on GitHub and open a Pull Request from your branch to the `main` branch.

## Using Issues and Discussions

-   **Issues:** Use GitHub Issues to report bugs, propose small changes, or ask specific questions that require a clear resolution.
-   **Discussions:** For broader ideas, new feature proposals, or general questions that might lead to open-ended conversations, please start a GitHub Discussion. This helps align scope before significant work.

## Style Guidelines

-   **Clarity and Neutrality:** Write in a clear, concise, and neutral tone.
-   **Evidence-Based:** Where applicable, cite standards, regulations, or established principles.
-   **Bilingual:** If possible and relevant, provide content in both Arabic and English, especially for posts.

## Commit Messages

Please use [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to keep the commit history clean and understandable. Examples:
-   `feat(standard): expand “shall” requirements to 40 items`

-   `fix(checklist): clarify EU AI Act high-risk definition`

## Review Process

-   All Pull Requests will be reviewed.
